Dofus Recipe Calculator is a tool to help crafters calculate how many items are
needed for batch crafting based on the number of certain ingredients in their
inventory.

RUNNING WITHOUT INSTALLATION

ruby -Ilib bin/dofus-recipe-calculator.rb

TUTORIAL

Running the program should present the main menu:
1. Edit inventory
2. Batch craft
3. List items
4. List recipes
5. Quit

First enter [1] to edit inventory; here you should enter ingredients you will
craft with, and the numbers you have. Say you have 12 Bird Meat *, 4 Pinch of
Temporal Powder. Then enter as follows (the things you type are highlighted in
[ ] here, don't actually type brackets):

| Enter an item:
| ?  [Bird Meat *]
| Enter amount to increase/decrease: [12]
| Inventory:
| 12 Bird Meat *

Don't enter Pinch of Temporal Powder for now (you can do it, but it's better
to do it later, as you'll see), and just press [Ctrl-C] to go back to main menu.

Now enter [2] to craft. The program will show a list of recipes you can choose
from based on your inventory.

| Possible recipes with current inventory:
| 1. Preserved Bird Meat = 2 Pinch of Temporal Powder, 1 Bird Meat *

(If you entered Pinch of Temporal Powder before, then here you will get a lot of
other recipes in the menu, because they also have that ingredient. That's why
it's better to not enter such ingredients before crafting.)

Enter [1] to use the recipe. The program will ask if you will buy more Bird Meat
to craft. If it was an ingredient like Pinch of Temporal Powder you would say
yes, but here you would say no.

| Will you buy more of Bird Meat * for this batch? [n]

Now the program will show how many times the recipe can be applied, and update
your inventory:

| Recipe performed 12 times.
| Inventory:
| -24 Pinch of Temporal Powder, 0 Bird Meat *

And your inventory is now empty so you won't be able to craft more, before
editing the inventory.

| No recipe can be used with current inventory
| Inventory:
| -24 Pinch of Temporal Powder, 0 Bird Meat *

But it says you have -24 Pinch of Temporal Powder. This actually means 24 of
them were used in the batch. So if you have 0 to start with, you should buy
24 before you craft in the game. If you have 4 to start with, you can now
edit the inventory:

| Enter an item:
| ? [Pinch of Temporal Powder]
| Enter amount to increase/decrease: [4]
| Inventory:
| -20 Pinch of Temporal Powder, 0 Bird Meat *

And you know that you only need to buy 20.

TIPS

- After you enter an item, you will get the prompt to enter an item again. Same
with recipes as long as the last craft didn't exhaust your inventory. If you
don't want to enter another item or craft again for now, just press Ctrl-C
to go to main menu.

- You can enter all your meat/fish at the beginning, and then do the
recipes together, and the inventory will still show how many items you need
to buy in total for all the recipes.

- When entering items and recipes you can type the first few letters and press
TAB to use auto-completion. Unfortunately this currently doesn't work if there
are more than one items/recipes that start with the letters you type.
